# Neural Network

Neural network able to learn the XOR function.

## Architecture
The makefile of the neural network can be found in Project1/NeuralNetwork. Write "make" to compile the neural network.

```bash
make
```

The .c files of the neural network can be found in the directory Projet1/NeuralNetwork/src and the headers can be found in the directory Projet1/NeuralNetwork/include.

Write "./ocr" to run the exectable.

```bash
./ocr
```
# traitement image /segmentation
## Architecture
The makefile of the neural segmentation/grayscale can be found in projetocr/Project1/SDL_traitement d'image. Write "make main" to compile the segmentation/grayscale code.

```bash
make
```
