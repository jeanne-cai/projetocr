# Neural Network

Neural network able to learn the XOR function.

## Architecture
The makefile of the neural network can be found in Project1/NeuralNetwork. Write "make" to compile the neural network .

```bash
make
```
The .c files of the neural network can be found in the directory Projet1/NeuralNetwork/src and the headers can be found in the directory Projet1/NeuralNetwork/include.

Write "./ocr" to run the exectable.

```bash
./ocr
```
